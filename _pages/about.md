I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Insitute](https://ecse.rpi.edu/), where I focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I completed over five advanced courses in the field, including Intro to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Probabilistic Graphical Models. Several of my final projects, which bridge theory with real-world applications, are showcased on the Projects page.

Beyond my core curriculum, I explored topics such as computer system design, algorithms, and quantum computing. One project I‚Äôm especially proud of involved a digit classification task that I implemented and ran on [IBM‚Äôs Quantum System One at RPI](https://news.rpi.edu/2024/04/05/rensselaer-polytechnic-institute-and-ibm-unveil-worlds-first-ibm-quantum-system-one), detailed on the Projects page.

I‚Äôve also developed practical industry skills through training at Tuwaiq Academy in Riyadh. I‚Äôm currently pursuing opportunities in machine learning research and development.
